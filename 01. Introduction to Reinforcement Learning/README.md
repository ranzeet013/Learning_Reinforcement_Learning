## Introduction 

This project is part of my journey in learning reinforcement learning, focusing on the foundational concepts introduced in the first chapter of the book **"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"** by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. The exercises help build a solid understanding of reinforcement learning principles and their practical implementations. Each exercise has been carefully completed to ensure a comprehensive grasp of the material.

## Exercises

#### Define and Implement the Action Space for a Simple Environment
- Description: This exercise involves defining the possible actions that an agent can take in a simple environment. The action space is a crucial component in reinforcement learning as it determines the set of all possible actions available to the agent. Implementing this helps in understanding how agents interact with their environment.

#### Define and Implement the State Space for a Simple Environment
- Description: This exercise involves defining the state space for a simple environment. The state space includes all possible states in which the environment can exist, providing the context for the agent's actions. By implementing the state space, we gain insight into how the agent perceives its environment.

#### Implement a Reward Function for the Grid World Environment
- Description: This exercise involves creating a reward function for the grid world environment. The reward function is essential in reinforcement learning as it defines the goal of the agent by providing feedback on its actions. Implementing this function helps in understanding how rewards influence the agent's behavior.

#### Implement a Simple Environment and Agent
- Description: This exercise involves creating a simple environment and an agent to interact with it. The environment provides the setting in which the agent operates, and the agent is responsible for making decisions and taking actions. Implementing both helps in understanding the dynamics between the agent and its environment.
- Implementation: [Implement a Simple Environment and Agent.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Implement_a_simple_environment_and_agent.ipynb)

#### Implement a Simple Epsilon Greedy Policy
- Description: This exercise involves implementing an epsilon-greedy policy for action selection. The epsilon-greedy policy is a fundamental approach in reinforcement learning that balances exploration and exploitation. By implementing this policy, we learn how agents can make decisions that optimize long-term rewards.
- Implementation: [Implement a Simple Epsilon Greedy Policy.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Implement_a_simple_epsilon_greedy_policy.ipynb)

#### Implement a Simple Grid World Environment
- Description: This exercise involves creating a simple grid world environment. The grid world is a common testbed for reinforcement learning algorithms, providing a structured and easy-to-understand setting. Implementing this environment helps in visualizing how agents navigate and learn within a grid.
- Implementation: [Implement a Simple Grid World Environment.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Implement_a_simple_grid_world_environment.ipynb)

#### Implement the Greedy Policy in Gridworld
- Description: This exercise involves implementing a greedy policy in the grid world environment. The greedy policy always selects the action with the highest immediate reward, providing a baseline for comparison with other policies. Implementing this policy helps in understanding the trade-offs between immediate and long-term rewards.
- Implementation: [Implement the Greedy Policy in Gridworld.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Implement_the_Greedy_policy_in_gridworld.ipynb)

#### Simulate Different Policies and Compare Their Performance
- Description: This exercise involves simulating different policies and comparing their performance. By implementing various policies, we can observe how different decision-making strategies affect the agent's success. Comparing these policies helps in identifying which strategies are more effective in different scenarios.
- Implementation: [Simulate Different Policies and Compare Their Performance.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Simulate_different_policies_and_compare_their_performance.ipynb)

#### Simulate the Deterministic Policy in Gridworld
- Description: This exercise involves simulating a deterministic policy in the grid world environment. A deterministic policy always selects the same action in a given state, providing a consistent behavior for analysis. Implementing this policy helps in understanding how fixed strategies perform in a dynamic environment.
- Implementation: [Simulate the Deterministic Policy in Gridworld,ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Simulate_the_deterministic_policy_in_gridworld.ipynb)

#### Simulate the Interaction Between the Agent and the Environment
- Description: This exercise involves simulating the interaction between an agent and the environment. The interaction dynamics are crucial in reinforcement learning, as they determine how the agent learns from its experiences. By simulating this interaction, we gain insight into the learning process and the factors that influence it.
- Implementation: [Simulate the Interaction Between the Agent and the Environment.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Simulate_the_interaction_between_the_agent_and_the_environment.ipynb)

#### Simulate the Random Policy in Gridworld
- Description: This exercise involves simulating a random policy in the grid world environment. A random policy selects actions at random, providing a baseline for understanding the role of randomness in decision-making. Implementing this policy helps in comparing random behavior with more structured policies.
- Implementation: [Simulate the Random Policy in Gridworld.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Simulate_the_random_policy_in_gridworld.ipynb)

#### Write a Program to Simulate Random Actions in the Grid World Environment
- Description: This exercise involves writing a program to simulate random actions in the grid world environment. Simulating random actions helps in understanding the baseline performance of an agent with no prior knowledge or strategy. This provides a contrast to more sophisticated policies and highlights the importance of learning.
- Implementation: [Write a Program to Simulate Random Actions in the Grid World Environment.ipnyb](https://github.com/ranzeet013/Learning_Reinforcement_Learning/blob/main/01.%20Introduction%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning/Write_a_program_to_simulate_random_actions_in_the_grid_world_environment_.ipynb)
